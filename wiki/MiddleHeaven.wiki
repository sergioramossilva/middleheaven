MiddleHeaven aims to be a full-featured business application framework 
with theses goals: 
*Minimize all effort concerning non-functional requirements. 
*Maximize reusability of business code and logics 
*Minimize dependency of third-party libraries (but used them under the hood) 
*Maximize extensibility

These goals are expressed by the following features: 
*Universal MVC : You code your logic in a totally view independent way, 
MiddleHeaven plugs it on Web or Desktop UI on demand. 
*Ubiquous Data Access: Access you data from any node on the system. 
Let MiddleHeaven worry with the details of data consistency and database persistence. 
*Out-of-box application patterns implementations like Money and UnitOfWork.
