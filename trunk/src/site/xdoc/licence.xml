	<p>
 The following is a BSD license template. To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own. Also, you may optionally omit clause 3 and still be OSD conformant.

    Note: On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved the "Simplified BSD License" variant used by FreeBSD and others, which omits the final "no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.

    Historical Note: The advertising clause (#3 in the original 4-clause BSD License) appearing on BSD Unix files was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He states that [the previous] clause 3 is "hereby deleted in its entirety."
