 * Utility classes to work with sequences.
 * Sequences are series of values that are used one after the other.
 * Random sequences are provided where the values do not follow a pre-determinated 
 * order.
 * Persistable state sequences can store and retrieve they state maintaining a strictly increasing
 * sequence of values.
