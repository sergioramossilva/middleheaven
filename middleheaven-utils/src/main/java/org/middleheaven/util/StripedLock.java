 * index of lock in array equals to <code>id & (locks.length - 1)</code>.
 * Since <code>locks.length</code> is the power of 2, <code>locks.length - 1</code> is string of '1' bits,
 * and this means that all lower bits of argument are taken into account.
 * <p>Number of locks it can hold is bounded: it can be from set {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.
